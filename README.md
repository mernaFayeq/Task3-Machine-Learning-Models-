# Task3-Machine-Learning-Models-
3 typs of machine learning models

I concatenated the stories files into one dataframe, then I started to train different Machine Learning Algorithms to see how they will Perform on the data.

I used the following algorithms and the accuracies was:

1- For Naive Bayes: 81%

2- For Support Vector Machine: 84%

3- For Artificial Neural Network: 87%
